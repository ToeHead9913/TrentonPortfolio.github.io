            <p>  My name is Trenton Gharst, I'm from Belton, Missouri. I'm currently in the KU coding bootcamp.
                 Some of the things I am learing are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm interested in coding and
                 programming because I find the field interesting and it is always growing so I will always be learning.
                 I was always wanting to learn the way the code behind something works, now that I am I can't wait to get into the workforce
                 and use my coding knowledge in a more professional setting.
            </p>
